## Let's work together!


I'll join Princeton as an assistant professor in Spring 2025 --- Let's work together! If you...  

- Want to do a PhD, please apply to [Princeton's CS program](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/grad).
- Are in Princeton's CS PhD program, please reach out by email.
- Have a PhD, please see [post-doc/fellowship opportunities at CITP](https://citp.princeton.edu/programs/fellows/).

In general, feel free to email me, and I will do my best to reply!  

## Advising style

I am hands-on. 
I try to explicitly set goals  and rituals, 
but adapt my involvement to feedback (implicit and requested) 
and the current challenges we are facing in the research project. 
I expect that my students' interests will shape my lab's direction.  

Examples of projects with master students I advised:

- [Prevalence and prevention of large language model use in crowd work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15683) (to appear at Communications of the ACM; Venia went on to do his doctorate at Princeton);
- [On the Conversational Persuasiveness of Large Language Models: A Randomized Controlled Trial](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14380) (informed [Anthropic‚Äôs model evaluation strategy](https://www.anthropic.com/news/measuring-model-persuasiveness); This is currently under review at Nature Human Behavior);
- [Quotatives Indicate Decline in Objectivity in US Political News](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15476) (published at ICWSM; Tiancheng went on to do his doctorate at Cambridge);


## Research flavor


I like doing research that tackles real-world issues and provides actionable insights.
Ideally, these insights translate into policy and design changes. This often requires‚Ä¶

- **Expertise in machine learning**. Understanding the nuts and bolts of AI or machine learning models is key. E.g., see [this](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/22223) paper to see how even simple collaborative filtering algorithms eluded social scientists for quite a while.
- **Answering causal questions**. This entails using applied causal inference methods and statistical models, designing experiments, and finding "natural experiments" in observational data.
- **Building infrastructure to collect data and run experiments**. E.g., designing bots to audit YouTube or experimental platforms to conduct synchronous experiments.
- **Working closely with companies and other stakeholders**. E.g., in the past, I‚Äôve worked with Meta, Reddit, Microsoft, and Prolific.

## Research topics

I am currently interested in three broad, interconnected research topics.
- **Measuring and modulating the impact of generative AI in society.** 
How will LLM-generated propaganda and sockpuppetry shape people‚Äôs opinions? How will Generative AI change crowd work? 
I believe generative AI will shape the world in the coming years, and I‚Äôm interested in research that minimizes the harms
and maximizes the benefits of this new technology.[^1]ùÑí[^2]ùÑí[^3]
- **Improving content moderation and algorithms in online platforms.** What is the effect of deplatforming influencers
from social media? How do we align recommender systems to user values? The way we design and curate content on online
platforms is still ill-informed by rigorous academic research. I started to address this gap during my PhD and want 
to continue doing so as a professor.[^4]ùÑí[^5]ùÑí[^6]
- **Using large language models to study human behavior.** Large language models allow you to create reasonably good
predictive models of human behavior and preference. How can this help the social sciences? This is the direction I‚Äôve 
explored the least, although it may be the one I‚Äôm the most excited about.

Those are things I intend to pursue, but, as I said, I expect the interests of my students will shape the direction of 
my lab. I‚Äôm keen to explore new (related) directions!
